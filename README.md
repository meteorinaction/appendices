Code for appendices of Meteor in Action

## About this repository

This repository contains the source code mentioned in the Manning book [Meteor in Action](http://www.meteorinaction.com), written by [Manuel Schoebel](http://www.manuel-schoebel.com) and [Stephan Hochhaus](http://yauh.de).

### Branches

The code for each appendix is pushed to a dedicated branch. All pushes are eventually merged to `master`, so that the final result of the appendices can be viewed.

Typically, each commit is associated with a Listing in the appendix unless noted otherwise.

### Issues and discussion

While the book is in the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) both written content and code are subject to change frequently. If you find issues feel free to open a ticket in the github repo or [join the book's discussion forum](http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=928) and let us know what you think.
